SwitchCaseExamples

This project demonstrates the use of the switch-case statement in C#. The switch-case structure provides a cleaner alternative to multiple if-else statements by allowing different blocks of code to execute based on the value of a variable.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Day of the Week Selection: Using switch-case to determine the day of the week based on a number from 1 to 7.
    Basic Calculator with Operators: Performing basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) based on the operator entered by the user.

Code Examples

In this project, we cover:

    Using switch-case to map numbers to days of the week.
    Implementing a simple calculator that performs operations based on a selected operator.
    Handling default cases when the input does not match any valid case.

Example Output

    Enter a number (1-7) to get the day of the week: 3
    Wednesday

    Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
    Enter the first number: 4
    Enter the second number: 5
    Result: 20

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file and follow the prompts to explore switch-case functionality with different inputs.

Purpose

This project is intended for beginners to understand how to use switch-case statements in C# to perform specific actions based on various conditions.
